# Wellness Directory Website

A professional and responsive wellness directory website built using WordPress and Elementor. The site is designed to connect users with various wellness professionals and services such as coaches, therapists, and nutritionists.

I recently worked on improving the layout, refining the directory listings, and optimizing the site for both mobile and desktop views. The site also includes clear service categories for better navigation.
